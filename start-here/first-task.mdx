## How to Talk to Kairos

Kairos understands natural language. Just describe what you need done, like you would to a human assistant.

### Example: Email Cleanup

Let's start with something simple â€” cleaning up your inbox:

<CodeGroup>
```text Text Input
"Go through my Gmail inbox and:
1. Archive all newsletters older than a week
2. Flag any emails from my manager
3. Create a draft reply for meeting requests
Let me know what you found when you're done."
```

```text Voice Input
Simply click the microphone and say:
"Hey Kairos, can you help me clean up my inbox? 
Archive old newsletters and flag important emails from my boss."
```

```text Screen Share
Share your screen showing your inbox and say:
"See these emails? Can you help me organize them?
Archive the promotional ones and highlight anything urgent."
```
</CodeGroup>

## What Happens Next

  <Step title="Kairos Understands">
    Kairos processes your request and identifies the specific tasks:

    - Filter emails by type and date
    - Perform actions (archive, flag, draft)

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about outcomes">
    Instead of: "Clean my inbox"
    
    Try: "Archive promotional emails older than 7 days, flag emails from my team, and draft responses to any questions"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide context when needed">
    "My manager is Sarah Chen" or "I only care about emails from these 5 clients: [list]"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Start simple, then expand">
    Begin with single-tool tasks, then combine tools:
    - First: "Organize my Gmail"
    - Then: "Check Gmail for meeting invites and add them to my calendar"
    - Finally: "Review my emails, add meetings to calendar, and post a summary in Slack"

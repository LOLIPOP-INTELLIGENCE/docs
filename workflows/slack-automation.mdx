## Overview

Transform Slack from a distraction into a productivity tool. Kairos monitors channels, posts updates, and keeps your team informed â€” all without constant context switching.

## Basic Slack Workflows

### Smart Notifications

```text
"Monitor #engineering channel and:
- Alert me for production issues

## Overview

Stop drowning in email. Kairos can manage your inbox like a skilled assistant â€” triaging messages, drafting responses, and keeping you focused on what matters.

## Basic Email Workflows

### Inbox Zero

```text
"Go through my inbox and:
- Archive all newsletters and promotions
- Flag emails from my direct reports
- Star client emails
- Create draft responses for questions
- Summarize what needs my attention"
```

### Smart Email Triage

```text
"Check my email every 2 hours and:
- Auto-reply to meeting requests with my calendar link
- Forward invoices to accounting@company.com
- Move GitHub notifications to 'Dev' folder
- Alert me on Slack for urgent emails from VIP list"
```

### Follow-up Management

```text
"Review my sent emails from the past week:
- Find emails with questions that haven't been answered
- Draft polite follow-ups
- Schedule them to send tomorrow morning
- Create a list of pending responses in Notion"
```

## Common Patterns

### The Executive Assistant

Perfect for busy leaders who need smart email management:

```text
"Act as my email assistant:
- Screen all incoming email
- Draft responses for routine requests  
- Schedule meetings based on my calendar
- Only interrupt me for CEO, board members, or emergencies
- Send me a 5pm summary of handled items"
```

### The Customer Success Flow

Ideal for support teams:

```text
"For each customer email:
1. Check their account status in our database
2. Review previous support tickets
3. Draft personalized response
4. If technical issue, create Jira ticket
5. Update customer record with interaction"
```

<Note>
  **Remember**: Start simple and add complexity as Kairos learns your preferences. It gets better at mimicking your communication style over time.

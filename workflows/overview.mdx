## What Are Workflows?

Workflows are multi-step tasks that Kairos can handle from start to finish. Think of them as recipes â€” you can use them as-is or customize them for your needs.

## Creating Custom Workflows

Every workflow can be customized. Just tell Kairos:

1. **What to do**: The specific steps
2. **Where to look**: Which tools and accounts
3. **How to handle edge cases**: What to do if something's unclear
4. **When to run**: One-time or recurring

### Example Custom Workflow

```text
"Every Monday at 9am:
1. Check my Gmail for client emails from the weekend
2. Create a priority list in Notion
3. Draft responses for urgent items
4. Schedule less urgent replies for Tuesday
5. Post a summary in #client-updates Slack channel
Call this my 'Monday Client Triage' workflow"
```

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Start with a simple workflow and add complexity over time. Kairos remembers what works and suggests improvements.

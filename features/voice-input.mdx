## Overview

Sometimes it's easier to explain than to type. With voice input, you can delegate tasks to Kairos just by speaking — perfect for complex requests or when you're on the go.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Microphone">
    Look for the microphone icon in your Kairos chat interface
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Speaking">
    Speak naturally — no special commands needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review & Confirm">
    Kairos transcribes your request and confirms before executing
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Voice Command Examples

### Quick Tasks

<AudioExample>
"Hey Kairos, check my email and tell me if anything urgent came in while I was in that meeting"
</AudioExample>

<AudioExample>
"Can you look at my calendar for tomorrow and send reminder emails to all attendees?"
</AudioExample>

### Complex Instructions

<AudioExample>
"I need you to go through my Slack messages from today, find all the action items that were assigned to me, add them to my Notion task list, and then post a summary in our team channel saying I've logged everything"
</AudioExample>

### Stream of Consciousness

<AudioExample>
"So I just got out of a client meeting... they want three things: first, a proposal for the new feature by Friday - can you draft that based on our template? Second, they need usage data for last quarter - pull that from our analytics. And third, schedule a follow-up meeting for next week. Oh, and add all this to the CRM"

## Best Practices

### Be Conversational

Instead of rigid commands, speak naturally:

❌ "Execute email scan protocol for priority messages"  
✅ "Check if I got any important emails"

❌ "Initiate data extraction from spreadsheet alpha"  
✅ "Can you grab the numbers from that sales spreadsheet?"

### Provide Context

Give Kairos the full picture:

<AudioExample>
"I'm preparing for my board meeting tomorrow. Can you review my presentation slides, check if all the data is up to date, and create a one-page summary of key points? The presentation is in my Google Drive called 'Q4 Board Deck'"
</AudioExample>

### Batch Related Tasks

Combine multiple related requests:

<AudioExample>
"For the product launch next week: update the project status in Notion, send a reminder to the marketing team on Slack, check if the landing page copy was approved, and schedule social media posts for launch day"
</AudioExample>

## Advanced Voice Workflows

### Meeting Mode

<AudioExample>
"I'm about to jump into back-to-back meetings. For the next 3 hours, monitor my email and Slack. If anything urgent comes up from my manager or about the Johnson project, text me. Otherwise, handle what you can and give me a summary when I'm done"
</AudioExample>

### Daily Briefing

<AudioExample>
"Good morning Kairos. Give me my daily briefing: what's on my calendar, any urgent emails, key Slack messages I should know about, and what tasks are due today"
</AudioExample>

### Project Updates

<AudioExample>
"I need to update the team on the website redesign. Check the project board for completed tasks this week, review the design feedback in Slack, note any blockers, and draft a status update email. Make it sound optimistic but realistic about the timeline"
</AudioExample>

## Voice + Screen Share

Combine voice with visual context:

<AudioExample>
"See this spreadsheet on my screen? I need you to clean up this data — remove the duplicates, fix the formatting, and then create a summary chart. Focus on the revenue columns"
</AudioExample>

</AccordionGroup>

## Common Voice Patterns

### The Morning Routine
"Check all my communication channels, handle anything routine, flag what needs my attention, and give me a priority list for the day"

### The End-of-Day Wrap
"Before I sign off, send any pending emails, update task statuses, post tomorrow's plan in Slack, and remind me of anything urgent for the morning"

### The Research Request
"I need competitive intelligence on [Company]. Check their website, recent news, social media, and any public financials. Put together a brief I can review before my call"

<Note>
  **Pro tip**: You can interrupt Kairos while it's working by saying "Hold on" or "Wait" if you need to add or change something.

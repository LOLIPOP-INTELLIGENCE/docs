## Screen Share Scenarios

### Data Entry & Forms

Share your screen showing a complex form:
```text
"See this vendor application? Fill it out using the company info 
from our database. For any fields you're unsure about, highlight 
them and I'll clarify"
```

### Email Management

Show your cluttered inbox:
```text
"Look at my inbox ‚Äî see all these newsletters? Unsubscribe from 
the ones I haven't opened in the last month, and create a filter 
to auto-archive the rest"
```

### Spreadsheet Work

Display a messy spreadsheet:
```text
"This spreadsheet is a mess. See how the data is all over the place? 
Can you reorganize it so each client has their own row with all 
their info in the proper columns?"
```

### Website Updates

Show your website backend:
```text
"I'm in WordPress now. See this blog post? Update all the images 
to use the new ones in the media library, and fix any broken links 
you find"
```

## Advanced Screen Share

### Multi-Step Processes

```text
"I'm going to show you our order process:
1. First, here's where orders come in [shows email]
2. Then we enter them here [shows CRM]
3. Finally, update this spreadsheet [shows tracker]
Can you handle the 10 orders that came in today?"
```

### Visual Training

```text
"Watch me do this once, then you take over:
[demonstrates task while sharing screen]
Now you try with the next batch. I'll watch and correct if needed"
```

### Design Feedback

```text
"Look at these mockups in Figma. For each one:
- Take a screenshot
- Note which elements need adjustment
- Create tasks in Notion for the design team
- Include the screenshots in each task"
```

## Combining Features

### Voice + Screen Share

The most powerful combination:

<Example>
üé§ "See this messy data on my screen?"
üñ•Ô∏è [shows spreadsheet]
üé§ "Clean it up, remove duplicates, and create a chart showing trends"
ü§ñ "I can see the sales data. I'll clean columns A through F, remove the 47 duplicate entries, and create a line chart showing monthly trends"
</Example>

### Screen Context

Help Kairos understand relationships:

<Example>
üñ•Ô∏è [shows CRM contact]
üé§ "This is our VIP client"
üñ•Ô∏è [switches to email]
üé§ "Reply to their email with priority handling"
ü§ñ "I understand this is the VIP client John Smith from the CRM. I'll draft a priority response to their email"
</Example>

## Screen Share Workflows

### The Daily Review

```text
"I'm sharing my task management screen. See all these tasks? 
Go through each one:
- If completed, archive it
- If overdue, flag it red
- If due today, move to 'Focus' column
- Update time estimates based on complexity"
```

### The Comparison Task

```text
"I have two documents open side by side. Compare them and:
- Highlight differences
- Note which version is more recent
- Merge the best parts of both
- Create a final version with track changes"
```

### The Bulk Operation

```text
"See all these files in my folder? For each PDF:
- Open it
- Check if it's an invoice
- If yes, extract the amount and date
- Add to our expense tracking sheet
- Move processed files to 'Completed' folder"
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Kairos Can't See Something

- Ensure you're sharing the right screen/window
- Check if content is behind a login (share after logging in)
- Some apps may need specific permissions
- Try zooming in for better visibility

### Privacy & Security

- Kairos only sees what you explicitly share
- Stop sharing anytime by clicking the stop button
- Sensitive information can be hidden before sharing
- All screen data is processed securely

<Note>
  **Quick tip**: Use screen share for showing problems, not just explaining them. "This doesn't look right" is much clearer when Kairos can see what you're seeing.

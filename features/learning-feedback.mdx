## Teaching Kairos

### Direct Feedback

The simplest way to help Kairos improve:

```text
"That email was too formal. Here's how I usually write to clients:
[provides example]
Use this tone going forward"
```

```text
"Perfect! Exactly what I needed. Do all weekly reports like this"
```

```text
"Not quite right — when organizing my calendar, always leave 
15 minutes between meetings for prep time"
```

### Learning by Example

Show Kairos your preferred approach:

<Example>
**You**: "Here are three emails I've sent to customers. Notice the tone and structure"

**Kairos**: "I see you use a friendly opening, bullet points for clarity, and always include next steps. I'll match this style"

**You**: "Exactly. And always mention our response time guarantee"

**Kairos**: "Noted. I'll include the 24-hour response guarantee in all customer emails"
</Example>

### Preference Setting

Tell Kairos your rules upfront:

```text
"Some preferences for how I work:
- Always draft, never send emails automatically
- Flag anything from my manager as urgent
- Use military time in all schedules
- Keep Slack messages brief and casual
- Add 30-min buffer before important meetings"
```

## Feedback Methods

### Quick Corrections

During or after a task:
- "Use 'Hi' instead of 'Dear' for internal emails"
- "Actually, move that meeting to Tuesday"
- "Add Sarah to the CC list for all project updates"

### Detailed Reviews

After complex tasks:
```text
"Let me review what you did:
✓ Great job on the data analysis
✓ The summary was perfect
✗ Next time, include year-over-year comparison
✗ Use percentage changes, not just raw numbers
Overall: 8/10 — keep the format but add those metrics"
```

### Process Improvements

Help Kairos optimize workflows:
```text
"I noticed you check each email individually. Instead:
1. Batch similar emails together
2. Process all meeting requests at once
3. Handle newsletters in bulk
This would be much faster"
```

## Advanced Learning

### Role-Specific Training

```text
"As my executive assistant, you should:
- Protect my focus time (9am-12pm daily)
- Be extra polite but firm when declining meetings
- Always check with me before scheduling anything on Fridays
- Know that 'Project Phoenix' is always top priority"
```

### Contextual Intelligence

Kairos learns situational awareness:

<Example>
**Situation**: End of quarter
**Kairos learns**: Prioritize financial reports, expect longer hours, be more careful with client communications

**Situation**: Product launch week
**Kairos learns**: Monitor social media closely, expedite customer responses, coordinate with marketing team more
</Example>

### Mistake Learning

When things go wrong:

```text
You: "That wasn't right — you scheduled the meeting during my lunch"

Kairos: "I apologize. I see you have 12-1pm blocked. Should I:
1. Always keep lunch hours free?
2. Ask before scheduling during lunch?
3. Only use lunch slots for urgent meetings?"

You: "Option 1 — always keep lunch free"

Kairos: "Understood. I'll protect 12-1pm daily and never schedule meetings during lunch"
```

## Building Trust

### Gradual Delegation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Simple">
    Begin with low-risk tasks to build confidence
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Complexity">
    As Kairos proves reliable, delegate more complex work
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Grant Autonomy">
    Eventually allow Kairos to handle routine tasks independently
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Continuous Improvement">
    Regular feedback keeps performance optimized
  </Step>
</Steps>
